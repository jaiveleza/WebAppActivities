# Event_Calendar

Having an online PHP event calendar to plan and manage multiple events can be good. You can also add notifications to remind yourself about the event on the date or a day before. Here, Iâ€™ve created the same demo on [how to add PHP event calendar in website](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/php-event-calendar-jquery-ajax/). 

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your iOS app and looking to [Hire PHP developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-php-developer/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
